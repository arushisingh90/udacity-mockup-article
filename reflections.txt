What new skills have you learned?

I have some experience with HTML so coding part was mostly a brush-up for me, but I did learn a new HTML element, figure. 
So far the benifit that I have seen is, this has gotten me into a habit of doing things outside work.  
From coding stand point I think I will start gaining more from the corse once we reach JS and start building projects from scratch using all three(HTML, CSS and JS) 

What has been easy?
Coding part has been easy so far

What has been difficult?

Getting into a habit of studying after work

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
